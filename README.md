# ChatGPT-Discord-Bot

Creating a Discord bot using Python and integrating ChatGPT into it can be a great way to showcase your skills. Below is a detailed guide on how to create a simple Discord bot that uses ChatGPT for generating responses.

# Prerequisites:

Discord Developer Account:

Create a Discord account if you don't have one.
Go to the Discord Developer Portal and create a new application to get your bot token.

Python:

Make sure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.

Library:

Install the Discord.py library using pip:

pip install discord.py

OpenAI API Key:

Obtain an API key for ChatGPT from the OpenAI platform. Visit OpenAI to sign up and get API access.

# Download my files:

There are 4 files: main.py, chat1.txt, chat2.txt, chat3.txt

# Running the Bot:

Invite the bot to your server:

Go to the Discord Developer Portal, select your application, and navigate to the "OAuth2" tab.
In the "OAuth2 URL Generator" section, select the "bot" scope, and copy the generated URL to invite your bot to a server.
Test the bot:

In your Discord server, use the command !ask <your_question> to interact with the bot and get responses from ChatGPT.

# Notes:

Replace 'OPENAI_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key.
Replace 'DISCORD_TOKEN' with the token you obtained from the Discord Developer Portal.

This basic setup allows you to showcase a Discord bot that interacts with ChatGPT. You can enhance and customize the bot based on your preferences and add more features as needed.
